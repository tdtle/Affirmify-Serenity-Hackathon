#Hackathon
Our group members partcipated in the 2024 Serenity Hackathon. An event hosted by Women in Computer Science and the Metropolitan Open-Source Society, both of which are affiliated with Toronto Metropolitan University. 
All 26 groups were tasked to create a prototype that will do one or more of the following:
    1. Address a significant mental health issue.
    2. Promote the overall mental well-being of individuals and/or communities.
    3. Integrate with existing platforms and services to enhance the overall mental health ecosystem.
    

Affirmify asks the user to rate their day on a scale of 1-10, then the user chooses from 5 life categories to curate a personal affirmation that resonates. 
After which an optional open response journal feature is implemented to document the event is provided.
Affirmify also keeps a history of the journals and organizes them based on the 5 life categories: 
  1. appearance
  2. finance 
  3. school/work 
  4. family/relationships
  5. other.
